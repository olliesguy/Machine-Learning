# Intro to Machine-Learning
In my attempt to rapidly understand and apply machine learning techniques to my MSc individual thesis, I have collated a number of tutorial codes (in Python) together.

This folder encompasses a variety of simple and applied machine learning algorithms. At the time of writing this includes:
* Logic Regression
* Random Forest
* Naive-Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Tree
* Neural Networks
	- Artificial
	- Recurrent
	- Convolutional

An effort has been made to standardise parameter names and comments across files to aid with learning across different algorithms.

## Library Requirements:
+ numpy
+ scipy
+ tensorflow
+ tflearn
+ sklearn
+ keras
+ pybrain
+ lasagne

## Datasets:
1. Iris
2. MNIST
3. Custom

## Resources:
To be added in due time.
